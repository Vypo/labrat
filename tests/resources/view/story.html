<br />
	The harsh, golden rays of the morning sun were the first thing Kaji saw the following day.  Blinding white light, ninety-three million miles away and mostly blocked by a set of pullstring blinds, somehow still managed to nail him right in the eye and disturb his peaceful slumber.  The blue and white-speckled bunnyfox yawned loudly and stretched his arms up.  Grogginess weighed upon his mind, the warm covers draped over his slender body keeping him trapped in a comfortable cocoon from which he just couldn't bring himself to escape.  He licked his dry lips and went to roll over to his right, only to topple onto another figure sleeping soundly beside him.  Violet and blue fur, messy pink hair, vulpine...<br />
<br />
	&quot;Feri.&quot; Kaji struggled to recall the events of the previous evening.  He remembered he'd meant to visit him after the hypnosis club meeting, but had gone back to his room for... something.  He couldn't quite recall.  There was something blocking everything out; a blur.  No, a glow.  A bright pink glow.<br />
<br />
	The boy's mind snapped back like a rubber band.  The swirling petals, the hypnotic spell Yuriko had woven over him, the things she'd had him do to Feri.  WITH Feri.  Heat flushed to his cheeks, and he bolted upright in the bed, startling the colorful fox awake.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Oh.  Morning.&quot; Feri yawned and sat up with him, looking just as confused as Kaji figured he had at first.  He lifted the covers and, after a quick glance down beneath the sheets, bit down on his lower lip. &quot;What did we..?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Yuriko.&quot; Kaji was hardly surprised to hear Feri murmur the name at the exact same time. &quot;Well, you remembered that fast.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;I've probably spent more time in trance than awake at this school.&quot; Feri's cheeks went red, and he stared at the equally-naked Kaji. &quot;So we...&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Does your ass hurt?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;That stopped being a good indicator a looong time ago.&quot; the fox giggled, brushing a lock of hair from his eyes and leaning over to kiss his bedmate.  Undisturbed by any bothersome roommates, the two held that kiss for a long time, hands roaming their slender frames until Feri pulled back and, very casually, asked, &quot;Does yours?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;No.&quot; Kaji couldn't help but smile.  As bashful as he felt, he only remembered good things about last night.  Even the trance Yuriko had put them under which, for his part, had been done with dubious consent at best.  He gave his vulpine lover's chest a poke. &quot;And that IS a good indicator for me, you little slut.&quot;<br />
<br />
	The other boy's cheeks blazed red, and he playfully pushed Kaji back down against the sheets. &quot;Hush.&quot; Violet and green eyes flicked to the Hello Kitty alarm clock on his nightstand.  Six in the morning. &quot;At least we're up early enough and didn't miss any classes.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Early enough for some more?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;More what?&quot;<br />
<br />
	Kaji took hold of Feri's shoulders and pulled him down with him.  Their lips locked again, and his girlish hands squeezed the plump rump of that lithe fox boy.  If he was going to be naked in bed with him, he was going to make the most of it!  Regrettably, his class schedule was still as fresh in his mind as ever, and he knew he'd have to wrap it up before anything really fun could happen.  But a little tongue-tying wouldn't make him late.<br />
<br />
	Feri seemed to have the same idea.  His fingers immediately moved to comb through the fur on Kaji's back, dull nails raking his skin and sending pleasurable tremors over his effeminite frame.  The boys' lips competed for control, their tongues wrestling for that same purpose, hands roaming and exploring to find the most sensitive places to grope and squeeze.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Ghh...&quot; Kaji came up for a breath, a thin strand of saliva connecting their lips for just a moment. &quot;We really shouldn't get too uh... invested.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;I know.&quot; Feri crooned, diving in for another kiss.  Their shortage of time clearly didn't mean much to the purple and blue fox, and it quickly became less of an issue for Kaji as he felt Feri's shaft nudge up against his.<br />
<br />
	The next few moments almost seemed to blur; white noise clouded his thoughts, and before he could even process it, he was frotting firmly against Feri's shaft.  Electric pleasure shot through his nerves, wanton moans joining with Feri's as their lips parted again.  He became suddenly aware of how hot he was, and he threw off the blanket and took hold of Feri's hips while they rubbed their cocks together.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Hhh... harder.&quot; Feri slurred, his eyes glazed over.  The fox seemed entranced, coaxed into this sudden, intense arousal just as Kaji had been.  His wide, feminine hips rocked against the bunnyfox's own, a bright blue shaft dribbling precum and helping to make their frotting as slick and slippery as possible.<br />
<br />
	Even through the lusting haze, Kaji sensed something amiss.  When had this quick makeout session evolved into cocks grinding together?  The whole transition felt blurry in his mind, and he couldn't quite bring himself to care about the hows and whys.  Before he knew it, their tummies had been painted a creamy off-white, their howling moans echoing off the dorm walls and likely providing an uninvited wake-up call for their neighbors.<br />
<br />
	Again, everything went blurry.  The passage of time became apparent only when Feri's alarm clock went off.  The sudden sound jolted Kaji from whatever strange haze he'd fallen into, and he glanced at the beeping clock. &quot;Aw hell.&quot; he scrambled to his feet and frantically searched for his clothes, finding them in a pile on the floor. &quot;Sorry to fuck and run, but my class starts in five minutes!&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Wuuuh.&quot; Feri simply lay on the bed, sprawled out and drooling a little.  He lifted one shaky hand in a thumbs-up gesture, apparently too blissed out from his climax to even vocalize his acknowledgement.  Had Yuriko left triggers behind last night?  A worrying thought.  Having them go off in class would be... troublesome.<br />
<br />
	Kaji swallowed his concerns; he was going to be late as it was!  Dressing quickly, the bunnyfox scrambled out the door, leaving the molten puddle of happy fox to recover on his own time.  Whatever had spurred their lusts into action had been potent and well-hidden, and not entirely unwelcome.  It'd definitely be difficult to concentrate in class today.<br />
<br />
	He passed Vic and Lizzy on his way out--their knowing smirks, to his horror, proved how soundproof the bedrooms here were not. &quot;It isn't what you think, guys.&quot; he mumbled defensively.<br />
<br />
	&quot;I'm sure it's not.&quot; the dark-furred feline responded with a teasing giggle. &quot;It's probably hotter.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Vic bounded over and threw an arm over Kaji's shoulders. &quot;I dunno, man.  You insist you aren't gay, but you blush away from Colette and Yuriko, then climb in bed with Feri.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Yuriko's the entire reason I was in there!&quot; the bunnyfox huffed, trying to keep the image of the vixen hypnotist's glowing emerald eyes out of his head.<br />
<br />
	&quot;So she did get to you.&quot; Lizzy breathed out a short sigh.  She wandered over and brushed her fingers through the girly boy's hair. &quot;Nothing lasting, I hope?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;I don't really have time to check.&quot; Kaji reluctantly removed himself from his friends' reach and hurried for the door. &quot;Got a class starting in, oh...&quot; a quick glance at his watch. &quot;Now.&quot;<br />
<br />
	The felines wished him luck as he made his way outside to the campus grounds.  His math class was close, but the clock had just ticked nine in the morning.  He sprinted across the campus, dodging students strange and familiar alike, backpack slung over his shoulder.  If he was lucky, the teacher would forgive his lateness and let him slip in quietly.  He cursed Yuriko and her damnable triggers as he full-on tackled the door leading into the next building where his class was held.  As scary as the thought was, he knew he'd have to confront the powerful vixen later to set some boundaries.  And maybe thank her for the good time, at that...<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
	Feri glanced over at his clock.  Nine-thirty.  Had he and Kaji really spent that long groggily fucking?  For that matter, how long had he been laying here alone, staring at the ceiling and listening to...<br />
<br />
	Huh.  What had he been listening to?  He vaguely recalled a pleasant voice right at his ear, goading but seductive in tone.  If he focused real hard, he could even remember just barely feeling lips on his ear.  The thought made him shiver, and he slowly climbed out of bed.  Probably an after-effect from last night, he figured.  Though this voice, as he fuzzily recollected, wasn't quite as feminine as Yuriko's.<br />
<br />
	Shrugging, the fox hauled himself into the bathroom, swung a towel over the shower door, and turned the hot water on.  He rumbled ecstatically as he stepped in and felt the delicious wet heat fall upon his head, fingers tangling in his messy braided hair to undo the intricate ties and loops that kept it so pretty during the day.  His pink locks gradually untangled and draped down to his lower back, darkening just slightly as they soaked in the water raining down from the shower head.<br />
<br />
	Last night had been lovely.  He replayed the fuzzy memories over and over again as he shampooed his hair, his cheeks flushed pink.  Kaji had seemed less enthusiastic about Yuriko's forwardness, but he figured it'd take about a week for that to change.  If that other boi was half as much of a trance slut as he was, that'd be about how long he'd last.  The fox giggled at the thought while he applied a frothy, strawberry-scented shampoo to his chest fur.<br />
<br />
	His class didn't start until eleven today.  More music theory.  He was already decent with a guitar, but there was nothing wrong with getting better.  Just about the only thing that'd interest him more was that weird kind of magic Yuriko seemed to possess.  The magic that no one seemed to question, despite magic not... being real..?  Funny how unconcerned people were about it.  Funny how his mind never could quite hold onto the thought, like trying to grab a wet bar of soap...<br />
<br />
	Feri had just about let his mind wander with that when he felt something else fill out the room with him.  Another presence, not unlike someone standing beside him.  The pleasant heat of the shower went frigid for a brief moment, and he ducked under the warm water to keep himself from shivering.  A nervous flutter started in the pit of his stomach and worked its way up to his swiftly-beating heart. &quot;Uh... Hello?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Hi there.&quot; The husky, effeminate voice seemed to come from all around the shower stall.<br />
<br />
	Feri's ears pinned back, and he almost leapt from the shower and ran out naked into the hallway.  He might have, had a set of slender, tanned arms not slipped around his waist, and a flat chest hadn't pressed firmly against his back.  The fox squeaked in surprise and froze on the spot, his eyes wide with fear. &quot;How did you get in here..?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Oh, you know.&quot; That voice spoke right into his ear this time, deep, breathy, somewhat girly... and familiar!  He couldn't place it at first, but it slowly started to click in his mind.  As if to tie the memories together manually, the owner of that seductive voice asked, &quot;Have fun earlier?&quot;<br />
<br />
	So it was this... person who'd murmured to him before, who'd coaxed him into frotting with Kaji!  He still couldn't quite tell if this thing was male or female, though the complete lack of breasts seemed to imply the former. &quot;I did, but you didn't answer my question.&quot; He squeaked quietly as the intruder's dainty fingers began to toy with his nipples, tugging and pinching, squeezing and twisting. &quot;H-Hey..!&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Shhh.&quot; the most sibilant sound passed the other's lips and slithered right into the fox's mind, silencing his protest.  A girlish giggle preceded a teasing nip at the boy's ear, those naughty fingers rubbing slow circles around the fox's nipples. &quot;I have my ways of getting around unseen.  Even being in the same room while people have their fun.  Mmh, and you two were such fun to watch last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Yuriko..?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Oh please.  Do I look fuzzy?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Not what little I can see.&quot; Feri reexamined the hands so openly fondling his chest.  They were small like a girl's, but without a touch of fur--or any body hair that he could see.  Perfectly slender and smooth, dark, and most assuredly naughty.<br />
<br />
	The other giggled again and pressed their lips against Feri's neck in a slow, suckling kiss.  The fox sucked down a gasp as the most peculiar heat flowed from those lips and into his muscles, tingling like an electric shock and spreading slowly through his nerves.  His uninvited guest moaned quietly and grinded against his back--it was at this point that Feri discovered the newcomer's gender. &quot;Don't worry.  I don't mean any harm.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Th... Then what...&quot; That heat claimed him swiftly, spreading up into his head and across his shoulders, down his back and chest and into his tummy.  It wasn't a sweltering, uncomfortable heat; it was a desire.  A NEED.  And as the other male's fingers fell upon him again, he discovered the heat's secondary effect.  His nipples stiffened immediately, and he just managed to bite back an ecstatic howl as the pleasure jolted through every nerve that heat had managed to touch.<br />
<br />
	&quot;I think you know by now.&quot; Something curled around Feri's hardening shaft, and a quick glance downward revealed a long, slender tail tipped with a cute little spade.  Its length started black, but gradually faded to violet.<br />
<br />
	&quot;You're a... demon..?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Ding ding.  We have a winner.&quot; The other boy's sing-song voice oozed with desire, its melodic resonance causing Feri's knees to quiver.  Or maybe that was the firm squeeze his tail had given his cock. &quot;But don't worry.  I'm not a bad demon.  I just wanna hear you scream...&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Scream?&quot; Fear crept up in the fox's tummy, but was quickly replaced by a rippling shock of pleasure as that tail coiled tighter around his shaft.  It then loosened and tightened again, starting at the base of his cock and ending at the tip, releasing and constricting in a milking motion.  This newfound ecstasy brought a howling moan from Feri's lips, and he could practically feel his new companion's heart beat faster.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Mmh, yeah.&quot; the demon purred, bending forward to catch Feri as his knees buckled. &quot;Scream like that...&quot;<br />
<br />
	And scream he did.  That tail's teasing attack only grew more intense, and Feri was sorely unprepared for how sensitive his shaft had become after that tingling warmth completely enveloped his body.  His weight fell upon the boy holding him up, his legs too shaky and weak to hold him up.  It didn't take long for his moans and cries to become a cacophonous roar, their volume further compounded by the cramped acoustics of the shower stall.  Oh, what did his neighbors think?<br />
<br />
	&quot;Gonna cum for me, slut?&quot; the demon boy purred, his tongue slithering across the fox's ear.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Yessssss!&quot; Feri, all too happy to oblige, howled out his response as he made a sticky mess of the shower floor, his cock erupting in a series of hot, white spurts.  His head spun, and he almost didn't register when the dark-skinned demon stepped around from behind him and used that slinky, dextrous tail to cup his chin.<br />
<br />
	The seductive hellspawn was a sight to behold.  Not exactly tall--in fact, he might have been just an inch higher than Feri.  Dark skin, silvery-white hair, and a slender, androgynous frame.  Violet irises sat within dark black sclera.  Two curved horns, just as black, protruded from his skull.  He smirked down at the pleasure-addled fox and used his tail's grip on his chin to hold his gaze upright. &quot;You're fun.  Perfect for my little idea.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Wuh... What idea...&quot; Feri could hardly hold his head upright, but the magnetic pull of those eyes kept his gaze fixated upon that exotic stare.  A mistake, it would seem; those eyes had taken on an intense glow that immediately flowed into his mind.  It slithered and wisped right around his pathetic excuse for mental defenses, coiled around thoughts and desires, and filled him with an undeniable need to look, to listen, to obey the pretty demon boi standing over him.<br />
<br />
	The seductive, impish intruder smirked, an expression that sent the most pleasurable chills through the fox's body. &quot;Well that was easy.  And here I thought that arrogant fox was just talented.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Nuuuhhh...&quot; the fox's response might have sounded like words in his head, but they sure didn't stay together if so.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Oh well.  I'll get her eventually.  Gotta work my way up from the bottom.&quot; Demon boy's tail curled in a slow, gentle motion around Feri's neck, the spaded tip tickling under his chin. &quot;Now listen carefully, cutie, and sink nice and deep for me.  We've gotta make you nice and ready, after all...&quot;<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
	Kaji sat hunched forward, one arm supporting his head as he listened to his math professor drone on about some ridiculously uninteresting number theory.  Truly amazing, really, how much someone could pay for schooling, the majority of which was filler and fluff like this, simply meant to fill in arbitrary &quot;credits&quot; that roughly translated to &quot;shit that makes you pay colleges more money&quot;.  Scholarships had covered the majority of his tuition, else he'd have been really pissed about having to spend his morning listening to some old geezer ramble at length about triangles.  Spirals, on the other hand...<br />
<br />
	Whoa, that was a bad thought for the middle of class!  Though the more he thought about it, the more it made sense that spirals were intrinsically tied to mathematics; that is to say, to infinity.  A theoretical spiral with no end could swirl infinitely into itself, over and over and over and over again, endlessly spinning, endlessly--<br />
<br />
	Bonk!  Kaji's head hit his desk, and he jolted in place, turning a couple heads in the room but not managing to alert his professor.  His cheeks burned, and he tried to play it off as nothing, but the girlish giggle from behind reminded him that at least someone in the room realized what had been going through his head.  He had discovered, to a mix of excitement and discomfort, that he shared math class with Yuriko.  The nine-tailed vixen sat only a couple rows behind him, and had given him the most devilish smirk when he'd walked into the room.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Fuck, what am I gonna say to her?&quot; he thought as he idly doodled on his notes.  While he certainly hadn't given consent for the things she'd done, there was no denying that he'd had a good time.  That didn't make it right, though!  She clearly didn't have any respect for the club's founding principles of mutual respect and safe hypnosis practices.  But if she really was that bad, why hadn't anyone stopped her?<br />
<br />
	...Oh god, what if it wasn't a matter of will?  What if they simply couldn't?  There was definitely something mysterious about her; the way she almost seemed to conjure up magical spells to put people under her control.  He recalled the temporary power she'd implanted within him to mesmerize Feri.  Was it real, or just some illusion she whipped together to make her seem more powerful and, therefore, subconsciously weaken those who might oppose her?  The easiest way to beat someone in a game of wits was to convince them they'd already lost, after all...<br />
<br />
	But then again, Ildac was here.  In the flesh.  And he was definitely a real, living angel!  He was apparently quite poor at hiding it, but so far he'd kept himself hidden to all but a small handful of people.  If angels were real, then maybe magic was too.<br />
<br />
	Class began to wrap up, and Kaji felt a lump of anxiety settle into the pit of his stomach.  The choice now hung precariously over his head: Confront Yuriko, or just let the whole thing slide and hope she didn't mess with him too hard in the future?  Or... hope that she did..?<br />
<br />
	&quot;Stupid sexy hypno vixen and her stupid sexy hypno...ness.&quot; he cursed his indecision and tugged at his pure white hair.  Yes, it was hot!  But no, it was not ok to just warp his mind like that whenever she wanted!  Ugh, but at the same time, he wanted her to!<br />
<br />
	A tap on his shoulder practically made him leap out of his fur, and he spun around to see the vixen herself standing over his desk as the other students shuffled out of the classroom.  Yuriko wore a mysterious smile; not quite benevolent, not quite the devilish smirk she'd flashed him before.  A knowing look, for sure.  She kindly waited until everyone else had moved on before inquiring, &quot;Feeling ok, my dear?  You look frustrated.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;I... you...&quot; Kaji fumbled over his words.  The hand of fate had apparently chosen to push him right along to confrontation.  Taking a deep breath and steeling himself for any potential manipulations, he stood, straightened up, and opened his mouth to give her a piece of his mind...!  But all that summoned bravado fell apart in an instant.  He couldn't even blame her, either; he was just no good at being angry! &quot;Look, I uh... had a good time last night.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;I know you did.  I was there.&quot; the vixen grinned, brushing her thumb over the boy's cheek fur as she cupped his chin. &quot;Such cute playthings, you and Feri.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Yeah, about that.&quot; Kaji forced himself to shrug away from her touch, and was relieved when she didn't pursue him. &quot;I'm not... against what you did.  Or how you did it.  Oooor why you did it...&quot; Oh hell, his entire argument was falling apart, and she hadn't even countered it yet. &quot;I'm just against the uh... er...&quot; Was there even a word for what he was getting at? &quot;Just... you know...!  I didn't ask to be made into a plaything, is what I mean!&quot;<br />
<br />
	Yuriko's expression turned thoughtful, and she casually rocked forward and back on her heels while he struggled to put his concerns into words. &quot;Do you not like surprises?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;There's a comment about context in there that I really don't wanna liken this to.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;It's not the same as rape, if that's what you're playing at.&quot; Apparently his expression told her all she needed to finalize that assumption, and she smiled again. &quot;Tell me, Kaji: What is the number one thing the club emphasizes about hypnosis?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;That it... should be done safely, and--&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Not that.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Kaji chewed on his lower lip.  Giving her the answer she wanted felt almost like an admission of guilt, but he was too deep in this argument to just blow her off. &quot;That all hypnosis is voluntary.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;And you had no trouble falling under for me.&quot; The vixen's smile evolved into the most delicious smirk, and he had to force himself to avert his eyes from her deep emerald stare. &quot;So what does that tell you about yourself, Kaji?  If you're going to follow the club's line of thinking to the letter, it sure sounds like you wanted me to hypnotize you.&quot;<br />
<br />
	He felt his ears pin back involuntarily, and his tail tucked between his thighs.  Kaji couldn't tell which made him more uncomfortable; that she'd make that assumption after being told &quot;no&quot; multiple times, or the fact that she wasn't entirely wrong. &quot;I mean... I did, but--&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;So what's the problem then?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Timing is the problem!&quot; Some gusto managed to dredge itself up from the pit of his soul and light a fire in his tone.  He stomped a foot and glared at the confident fox. &quot;J-Just because I wanted it, didn't mean I wanted it then!  And--and you know, not every hypno-fetishist wants to be taken at any hour of any day..!&quot;<br />
<br />
	Yuriko, unfazed by his sudden stroke of confidence, took a step forward, her tails fanning out behind her in an obvious attempt to look far, far bigger than the feminine bunnyfox.  It worked incredibly well; Kaji could feel himself shrink backward before he even realized his legs had moved. &quot;The desire is there.  It is my wont to simply pluck it from its hiding spot and bring it out to play.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Y-Yeah, well...&quot; Kaji squeaked out his retort.  All that bravado had retreated already. &quot;Maybe if you asked... from now on?&quot;<br />
<br />
	Yuriko stared for a long moment, her smile having faded.  She seemed to be mulling it over; Kaji couldn't tell if it was genuine consideration, or if she was mocking him, and each passing second went on for an eternity.  Just as he'd begun to think he should put up a mental wall, in case she'd gotten bored of talking and decided to zonk him right then and there, she answered. &quot;I made you uncomfortable.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Uh--well...&quot; There was no need to sugarcoat at this point.  She hadn't asked; it was an observation more than anything. &quot;Just a bit.&quot;<br />
<br />
	The vixen took a breath and held it for a moment.  The look on her face wasn't exactly a repentant one; more sheepish than anything.  She looked this way and that, as if to check for something before she could speak genuinely. &quot;Well, I can't be right all the time.  I suppose I mistook you for someone like Feri, given how well you seem to get along with him.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;That's not... inaccurate, really.&quot; He knew he had to tread carefully here, lest he completely dismiss what was essentially the closest thing to an apology he'd heard thus far. &quot;Maybe Feri's ok with just being someone's toy at their whim.  And that's great if he does!  I just prefer some forewarning.  And maybe the chance to set some boundaries.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Hm.&quot; Yuri hummed thoughtfully in response, and her expression took a turn toward something resembling sympathy. &quot;I get the sense you've had a bad experience.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Ugh, Lily.  That wasn't something he needed included in this conversation. &quot;You could say that.&quot; he offered with a curt nod, but elected not to follow up.<br />
<br />
	&quot;I see.&quot; the kitsune woman breathed out heavily. &quot;Had I known, I'd have approached you in a far more delicate way.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;You never even bothered to ask.&quot; Kaji wanted to say it, but he bit his tongue.  Best to bury the hatchet. &quot;Long as we understand one another.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;We do.&quot; Yuriko smiled and extended a hand.  Kaji took it slowly, and his caution renewed just a hint of her smirk. &quot;Don't think this means you're off my radar, though.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;I never said I wasn't interested.&quot; the bunnyfox murmured, his cheeks flushed brightly. &quot;Anyway... thanks for understanding.&quot; A moment's pause, and he quietly added, &quot;And the good time.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;We'll do it again some time.&quot; The purr in her tone sent a thrill up the boy's spine.  Yuriko tickled lightly under his chin, turned on her heel, and started down the hall. &quot;Catch you later, cutie.&quot;<br />
<br />
	The butterflies in Kaji's tummy fluttered like mad at the very thought of that.  He finally allowed himself to relax as Yuriko headed down the hall and rounded the corner.  That had gone... surprisingly well!  Now if only the vixen at the heart of all that anxiety would keep her word, he might just stop imagining her eyes drilling into the back of his head every time they shared the same general space.<br />
<br />
	Those deep emerald green eyes...<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
	The hallways were mostly quiet between classes; athletics had yet to begin, and clubs wouldn't be starting until late afternoon.  The men's athletic showers, however, had gotten steamy early on today.  Leaned up against the back wall was a tall, naked mouse girl, her dark blue fur etched with peculiar silvery-blue spiral patterns from her shoulders down.  She moaned softly, cheeks flushed a bright pink, her knees trembling as she smirked at the boy between her legs; a white-furred jackalope, half-dressed in just a pair of blue harem pants, a dulled look in his bright green eyes as he swallowed the girl's shaft.<br />
<br />
	The intersex mouse girl bit back her sounds of pleasure, golden eyes shining in an otherworldly manner as she gazed down at the blushing, but eagerly sucking boy. &quot;Didn't take much to hypnotize you.&quot; she huffed, fingers twisting her stiff violet nipples. &quot;Such a cutie.  Even cuter in that dancer's getup.&quot;<br />
<br />
	The boy didn't answer, or perhaps whatever he'd managed to mumble in his mesmerized state had been muffled by the dick in his mouth.  The mouse didn't care either way!  She held onto the boy's antlers while he pleasured her, moaning and huffing, the swirling patterns in her fur glowing and shining brightly.  Her toes curled, and she tugged hard on those antlers as she rutted herself against the boy's face, bucking her hips hard until she could take no more!  A hot gush of seed filled her impromptu lover's mouth, and he eagerly drank down her essence.  The mouse woman glowed--literally and figuratively--as her climax went on.  She stifled her moans by clasping a hand over her mouth, then slowly pushed the jackalope's head away to relinquish the use of his maw once she was spent.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Fuck.&quot; she panted, grinning wide at the bedazzled and still quite hypnotized boy kneeling before her, his eyes fixated upon the glowing and color-shifting tip of her cock.  She giggled and shook her hips, then laughed aloud when the jackalope's eyes followed the swaying head. &quot;Oh, I love that... Mm, say...&quot; She shuffled forward and bent down to run a hand over his soft cyan hair. &quot;I could go another round.  Maybe you can follow me back to my dorm and I'll--&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Aura.&quot; A firm voice came from outside the showers. &quot;If you're quite done, we need to talk.&quot;<br />
<br />
	And there went the mood.  She mumbled to herself as she retrieved her clothes. &quot;Ugh, alright, I'll be right there.&quot; Turning to the boy on the floor, she snapped her fingers and quickly quipped, &quot;Up, up, up!  Rise and shine!  And clean off your face, cutie.&quot;<br />
<br />
	The jackalope's eyelids fluttered, and he took a swift, confused look around the room, eyes wide. &quot;Wuh--what did I... What did you..?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Teach me how to dance some time, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;W... Wait..!&quot;<br />
<br />
	Aura giggled and offered a wave over her shoulder as she dressed, quickly fixed her hair, and made for the door. &quot;Later!&quot; She passed an unimpressed white-furred fox as she left the showers, waited for the blushing jackalope boy to scramble past her, and leaned against the wall opposite to the one who'd called her out. &quot;Ildac.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Aura.&quot; the fox greeted her. &quot;Using your powers for good as always, I see.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;You should have seen the way he stared at me.  I swear, he practically drooled when I showed him the goods.  And that was before I hypnotized him.&quot; Aura smirked at the man's obvious discomfort.  The absolute smorgasbord of emotions flitting across his expression... &quot;What's so important that you'd interrupt my fun?&quot;<br />
<br />
	Ildac glanced around for a long moment, and Aura suddenly realized that it might actually be serious.  At the very least, she was going to get lectured.  Apparently content that no one was within earshot, the fox finally spoke. &quot;There's a demon on campus.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Huh!  No lecture. &quot;Is that all?  Figured you were mad at me.&quot; She wandered over to glance out a nearby window.  The groundskeepers busily mowed the athletic fields, clipped and watered the grass, and kept the campus's many flower beds vibrant and healthy.  If she reached out just right, she could sense the threads of divine energy floating in the air and string them together, allowing her soul to touch another, just for a moment.  The sensation was still odd to her, but so very useful in tracking people down.<br />
<br />
	&quot;I've come to terms with the fact that you'll never share my passionate respect for our purpose as celestials.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Your purpose.&quot; Aura corrected him with a smirk. &quot;As for your demon, my money's on the occultist club.  They probably found one of those stupid Tumblr posts about summoning things.  It'd be funny if one of them actually worked.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;No, it'd be disastrous.  However it got here, it's still a problem.&quot; Ildac persisted, his eyes following the mouse girl. &quot;Its inconsistent presence can only mean one thing: that it's attached itself to one of the students.  I still don't know exactly what we're dealing with, but I figured you ought to know.&quot;<br />
<br />
	She hummed as she stared up at the cloudless blue sky.  Something had felt out of place today, at seemingly random times.  She'd chalked it up to nerves.  The entire world had become so different practically overnight, once her celestial abilities had emerged in her teenage years.  Ildac's mentoring had helped keep her focused over the years, but being in such a large university, surrounded by so many people, sometimes overloaded the minor empathic senses she possessed. &quot;Well,&quot; she shrugged, largely unconcerned with the affairs of angels and demons, &quot;thanks for letting me know.  If anything happens, I'll give you a call.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Actually, I, uh...&quot; the sudden change in Ildac's tone puzzled her.  He almost sounded bashful. &quot;I was hoping, maybe, you'd help me take care of this?&quot;<br />
<br />
	Aura snorted. &quot;Help?  Why would you need my help?  I'm only a half-breed.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;I don't need your help.  I want it.&quot; the fox smiled. &quot;We never exactly played catch or went fishing, but... Well, how about a good old demon slaying with your old man, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
	For once, she couldn't bring herself to blow off such a comment.  She tried to stifle the flutter in her chest, and grumbled to herself when it just wouldn't go away.  Stupid sentimental...! &quot;Alright, fine.&quot; Aura tried to play it cool as best as she could.  She wasn't about to give him the satisfaction of stirring her heart like that. &quot;We'll play 'bring your daughter to work day' if it means that frigging much to you.&quot;<br />
<br />
	The fox's bright smile was an odd sight; he was always so stoic, and only ever seemed to soften around that wolf chick he always hung out with.  And with Aura.  Huh, she never really acknowledged it, but he did always seem happy to see her, even when forced to call her away from her little escapades. &quot;Thank you.&quot; Ildac's posture loosened as he seemed to relax a little.  Did he really think she'd deny him outright? &quot;Just be careful with the 'daughter' thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;I know, I know.  Respect the Masquerade and all that.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Wrong supernatural beings, but along the right line of thought.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Wait, you--&quot; Aura raised a brow. &quot;You know what that is?&quot;<br />
<br />
	Ildac grinned as he began to wander off. &quot;Your old man's not as stuffy as you might think.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Aura watched him depart, an amused smile finding its way to her lips. &quot;You think you know a guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Ah, but Ildac had a demon to find, and she had homework.  And potentially a second round with that cute dancer boy, if she could just remember his name and which dorm he slept in!<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
	Feri cautiously wandered through the halls of the main campus building, ears pinned back as he realized that he was being watched.  Not just by a few people, either; everyone in his immediate vicinity seemed to be leering at him, an unmistakable lust in their eyes.  He couldn't explain it; ever since he'd zoned out in the shower and gone to class, people had started acting weird around him!  It'd started subtly--the girl who sat behind him smooshed her tits against his cheek in passing, and one of the guys who sat beside him kept looking his way.<br />
<br />
	Then, after class, someone grabbed his ass.  Then someone else.  And someone else!  Feri rarely turned down this kind of attention, but to have it all descend upon him at once, by people who'd otherwise shown little to no interest, had him freaked out!  The insistent groping had quickly turned into a mob of people crowding him in the hall, a couple dozen hands reaching for him, caressing, stroking, teasing..!  The blushing fox trembled at the recollection--and felt his panties tighten just a little, for that matter.  This would be stupidly hot if it wasn't so random!<br />
<br />
	The dazed looks in their eyes were so familiar, like when people at the hypnosis club would sink into trance.  But most of these people had nothing to do with the club, so it wasn't some weird mass-triggering or the work of some cheeky hypnotist!  Really, if it was that, he'd be the FIRST person to go under, not the only one to NOT!<br />
<br />
	Unfortunately, that was all he could manage to piece together for what might be happening--or, more accurately, not happening.  The fact remained that people were now shuffling along behind him, arms outstretched like zombies, needy looks in their eyes as they began to pick up the pace.  Feri sped up gradually so as not to provoke any kind of weird, lust-fueled chase response, but it wasn't long at all before he was running away from the crowd!<br />
<br />
	&quot;Why are you all so horny?!&quot; he shouted back at the group, his cheeks hot with blush.  Again, he'd be more than happy to oblige some--even most--of these people if they'd just explain what was going on!<br />
<br />
	&lt;Ahh, that'd be my doing.&gt; A strange voice echoed in his mind.  Strangely familiar, even.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Wuh... You!  The--the boy from the shower!&quot;<br />
<br />
	&lt;Ooh, you remembered!  I'm impressed.  You went down like a sack of bricks.&gt;<br />
<br />
	Feri whined.  Now was not the best time to be reminded of his susceptibility to trance. &quot;What's going on?  What did you do to these people?!&quot;<br />
<br />
	&lt;I just nudged them a little.&gt; the girlish voice intoned in a soft, sing-song melody. &lt;Convinced them that you're the hottest thing on the planet, and that they need to fuck you.&gt;<br />
<br />
	&quot;That's not a little!&quot; Feri dodged between two people lunging at him from the front, his legs burning as the chase went on.<br />
<br />
	&lt;It is compared to what I could be doing...&gt;<br />
<br />
	&quot;That's not very comforting!&quot;<br />
<br />
	&lt;It isn't meant to be.&gt; The voice giggled as Feri slid around a corner and sprinted down the hall.  People at the back of the crowd began to lose steam, and almost seemed dazed and confused as the distance between them and Feri increased.  All he had to do was outrun them..!<br />
<br />
	&quot;Who... are you?  WHERE are you?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&lt;Inside.&gt; There was a sinister inflection place upon that word. &lt;I told you I had a plan, didn't I?  And now you're part of it.&gt;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Did you possess me?!&quot; Feri vaguely recalled their time in the shower--something else that caused his panties to tighten--and remembered that the boy looked an awful lot like a demon.  He would have taken that for some kind of hypnotic illusion, had this voice not invaded his mind.<br />
<br />
	&lt;Ding ding!&gt; the confirmed demon boy giggled. &lt;As a denizen of the underworld, my essence is largely intangible!  In other words, your body is also my body right now.  And so, if I wanted to, I could just...&gt;<br />
<br />
	A lead weight seemed to suddenly weigh Feri down, and he struggled to keep his legs moving. &quot;No... Nonononono!&quot; The boi groaned as his legs betrayed him, lurching forward and daring to glance back at the swiftly-approaching crowd. &quot;No, don't!  Not in the middle of the hall!&quot;<br />
<br />
	&lt;Pssh, no fun.&gt; All at once, the weight was released, and Feri could run again. &lt;C'mon, I took a peek at your mind.  We both know you'd enjoy it.&gt;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Yeah, but--!&quot;<br />
<br />
	&lt;Butts are for cocks.&gt;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Oh shut up!&quot; Feri groaned.  At least no one would think him odd for talking to himself right now.  That relief soon sank beneath a layer of dread when his legs began to slow again.  He pleaded for the demon inside to have mercy, and it almost seemed as if he might; he guided Feri to the right, then compelled him to duck into a room and slam the door behind him.  Peace, at last!  Or so he thought.<br />
<br />
	Looking forward, Feri's gaze fixed upon... bodies.  Buff, naked bodies.  His exhausted mind began to register other things; lockers, benches, showers.  Oh, he'd never felt such an odd mix of excitement and fear!<br />
<br />
	&quot;Well well, look who's back!&quot; A tall, toned zebra hollared, alerting the rest of the athletes in the room. &quot;Thought you'd had enough after we caught you snooping last week, you little slut.  Guess we'll have to teach you some manners all over again...&quot;<br />
<br />
	Feri squeaked pathetically as a whole team of big, muscular guys began to gang up on him.  The luster in their eyes began to dim as the demon boy's influence reached out to touch their minds, and their cocks throbbed to life. &quot;Eep...&quot;<br />
<br />
	&lt;Oh just relax.  They won't hurt you.&gt;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Oh I know what they're gonna do.&quot; Feri gulped as he was crowded up against a wall, an equine shaft nudged against his cheek.  A wolf cock followed, and then another horse dick!<br />
<br />
	&lt;You're too tense for a boy who literally did this on purpose a week ago.  Here... Lemme help.&gt;<br />
<br />
	Feri tried to protest, but the intense sensation of something spinning... spiraling... in his head just sent all of his worries floating away.  He found himself smiling blissfully, his mouth opening wide and accepting the zebra cock's insistent nudges.  He expertly gulped down as much as he could of that length (which wasn't much from this position, but he sure tried!) and firmly stroked and caressed the other two nearby cocks.  All around him, the boys who weren't immediately treated to the fox's ministrations began to stroke themselves, spurred on by the demonic siren song that now rang through the locker room.<br />
<br />
	&lt;Endless pleasure.  Ecstasy to stir the depths of your souls into blissful emptiness.  Stroke.  Suck.  Fuck...!&gt;<br />
<br />
	Feri let out a muffled moan, his own shaft throbbing powerfully in his tented-out panties and skirt.  The whole room began to fill out with the sounds of unrestrained pleasure; hot breaths and moans and groans, chiseled bodies leaned against walls or sprawled on the floor, stroking and tugging, some frotting up against one another, and three still crowding the dutiful, hypnotized fox who'd unwittingly stumbled inside at the best possible time.<br />
<br />
	Hours seemed to pass, and Feri tended to the hypnotized jocks one by one.  The demon's presence in his mind waxed and waned, but never quite left.  His seductive headmate didn't speak much while the show went on, apparently content to watch the results of his meddling play out.  Before too long, the entire locker room was filled with hot, panting, exhausted men (and one boi), with Feri slumped against the corner, the pure image of a stereotypical fox.<br />
<br />
	&lt;Man, those guys were a disappointment.&gt; Demon boy grumbled telepathically. &lt;Not one of 'em got far enough to fuck you properly.  Gotta say, though, I can't blame 'em much.  You've got a good mouth.&gt;<br />
<br />
	Feri responded with a groan, eyes half-lidded and ears pinned back.  He could hardly feel his jaw after all the sucking he'd just done, and only bits and pieces of awareness had just begun to flit back into his mind. &quot;I can't believe I... the whole team...&quot;<br />
<br />
	&lt;In such a short time, no less.  Damn, you're a slut.&gt;<br />
<br />
	&quot;You made me do it...&quot;<br />
<br />
	&lt;Well it's a good thing you're still awake.&gt; There was a hint of a smirk in that voice now. &lt;Because we're going next door.&gt;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Wuh...&quot; Feri racked his brain.  Even the school's layout managed to become lost in the hazy mess that was his head right now. &quot;What's next door again?&quot;<br />
<br />
	A devilish giggle rang through his mind. &lt;The girls' locker room.&gt;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Noooooo..!&quot; Feri whined and struggled against his own legs as he was strung along like a puppet, moving inexorably toward the adjacent locker room.  If it was even nearly as full as the guys', then he was in for a long night...<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
	The day went on; the last of the night classes and clubs let out, everyone shuffled off to dinner, then headed to the dorms to settle in.  The Block G lounge had largely quieted down as night fell over the campus.  Most of the night owls had gone up to study or game in their rooms, and the lights had been dimmed for the evening.  Only two students lingered; Vic, who casually browsed the internet on his phone, and Lizzy, laying on her belly across the big couch and studying some subject or another.  The grey-furred feline of the pair grumbled as he perused reviews of the latest controversial video game release. &quot;Man, FUCK this!&quot;<br />
<br />
	His shouting caused Lizzy to jump and turn around to face him. &quot;It's going on midnight, you asshat.  What are you yelling about?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;I'm yelling about goddamn Our Final Remnants Part Two!  How do you take seven years' worth of dev time and fuck up THIS hard?  I haven't been so disappointed since Soul of Kingdoms Three.&quot;<br />
<br />
	The darker feline rolled her eyes as she went back to her book. &quot;So, nerd rage.  Got it.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Oh shut up.  You just don't understand gamers.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;I understand they're a bunch of manchildren.&quot; Lizzy grinned, which only managed to annoy Vic even more. &quot;'Oh whaa whaa, this totally pointless thing I play didn't rim my asshole while I played it'.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;I'm about to rim your asshole.&quot; the tabby grumbled, not realizing that his comment brought a touch of pink to his fellow cat's cheeks.<br />
<br />
	&quot;If it gets you so upset, why are you reading about it?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;I read reviews when I get bored.  Now I'm bored AND pissed.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Lizzy snapped her book shut.  She sat up, spun around to face him again, and grinned. &quot;Poor boy.  Want me to hypnotize your rage away?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Better idea.&quot; Vic countered, standing and sauntering forward to lean over the other feline, a smirk finding its way to his lips. &quot;You let me hypnotize you for a change.&quot;<br />
<br />
	All of Lizzy's confidence seemed to drain away at once, and she shrank into the couch a little. &quot;W-What?  Out here?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;No one's around.  And it's been like a month since we switched it up.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Ah geez.&quot; the black cat's eyes darted around the room.  Everyone else was either in bed or otherwise occupied. &quot;I dunno, Vic.  We both know what you're like when you do.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Know what else we both know?&quot; Vic sat down beside her, further spurred on when she didn't make any effort to scoot away from him. &quot;That you love pretty stripy kitty tails.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Lizzy's gaze turned far-off for a second, and immediately focused on Vic's tail when he brought it up before her eyes. &quot;Oh fuck you and double-fuck that trigger.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;It wouldn't even work if you didn't want it to.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Triple-fuck that logic.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Uh huh.&quot; Vic coaxed the protesting feline into his lap, and she obliged in spite of her complaints. &quot;Don't worry.  No one's gonna see.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Lizzy's cheeks practically glowed, and she wiggled bashfully in his lap as her eyes followed the slow sway of his tail. &quot;I swear, if I feel a boner...&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;What're you gonna do, tail slave?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;I'm g--gonna--go...nna...&quot; Lizzy tripped over her words as her eyes once again glazed over. &quot;Be a good tail slave.&quot; Her expression contorted slightly, and she growled as lucidity returned to her gaze. &quot;Fuck.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;You love it.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;I do, and I hate that you know it.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Vic tried not to laugh--Lizzy was impossible to hypnotize when she was mad, even with triggers, and making fun of her would certainly set her off now. &quot;Good tail slave.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Bwuh...&quot; the dark-furred feline tried to speak, but once again jumbled every syllable.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Gooood tail slave.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;S-Stoo...ooooop...&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Good. Tail. Slave.&quot; This time he got no verbal response, but definitely felt her squeeze her thighs together.  He couldn't see from his position, but he knew Lizzy's eyes would be glued to the casual swishing and swaying of his tail. &quot;Back and forth, back and forth.  We kitties do it all the time; sway our tails back and forth.  So eye-catching, this simple motion.  So captivating.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Ssssooo... mmf.&quot; the thought didn't quite make it to Lizzy's lips, and her posture began to loosen.  Her own tail swayed and flopped beside her, lazily mimicking Vic's own as best as it could.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Breathe in deep.&quot; He waited, and his subject obeyed. &quot;Hold.  Hold.  Hold...&quot; His hands slipped around her waist and brushed against her bare midriff.  Toned muscles tensed, and he could hardly resist the urge to let those busy paws wander. &quot;Out.&quot; Lizzy exhaled, her head dipped forward, and her mouth hung open.  The beginning of a deep, rumbling purr awoke in her chest.<br />
<br />
	&quot;So loose already.  Very good.&quot; Vic grinned at the involuntary tremble which shook Lizzy's muscular frame. &quot;Yes, very good.&quot; Another tremble! &quot;Are you... a good girl, Lizzy?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Yesssss...!&quot; the cat girl's lightly arching back hardly betrayed the intensity of the pleasurable jolt she'd have received from that phrase.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Of course you are.&quot; Vic gently cupped her chin to keep her fixated upon the tip of his tail, which now twirled playfully in a circle before her eyes. &quot;Mm, you've used all different methods to hypnotize me.  But all it takes for you is a pretty kitty tail.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Mnnnh love... tail.&quot; Lizzy's voice was a mere whisper compared to her usual firm confidence.<br />
<br />
	&quot;And what does that make you?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;A... unnh...&quot;<br />
<br />
	Vic couldn't help but laugh quietly.  There was still some resistance wrapped around her thoughts.  Typical Lizzy. &quot;I can tell you if you want.&quot; The sudden tension in her muscles brought on another laugh. &quot;A tail slave.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Lizzy's thighs squeezed together again, and she let out a quiet, involuntary moan. &quot;Tail slave...&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Tail slave.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Tail slave..!&quot;<br />
<br />
	Heat flushed into Vic's cheeks as the feline woman's breaths turned to a soft, steady panting, and there was no stopping the inevitable: his pants tented out in a way that would have been blatantly obvious, had Lizzy's perfect ass not concealed it.  The tail-tranced girl's cheeks turned a deeper shade of red, and she absently rocked herself back against that bulge.  Funny how she never minded his perverse nature when her subconscious mind had center stage. &quot;We're the only ones here.&quot; he reminded her as the hand on her tummy dipped lower. &quot;No one else is coming.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Lizzy's breath caught for a moment when that hand slipped beneath the hem of her sweat pants, then deftly dove into her panties and pressed against her very wet labia. &quot;Nnuuhh... no one else...&quot; Her eyes followed the dizzying swirl of Vic's tail, her head clumsily swaying and turning in place.<br />
<br />
	&quot;We're alone here.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Weh... we...!&quot; the cat girl's voice rose quickly in pitch as Vic's fingers invited themselves inside her sensitive folds.  Now apparently content that they would not be disturbed, Lizzy swayed her hips and practically humped her hypnotist's invading digits as they pumped in and out of her.<br />
<br />
	Vic stirred his fingers inside of the squirming Lizzy, his tail keeping its dizzying motion going, holding her in a spiraling fuzzy prison.  His free hand gently covered the moaning woman's mouth to muffle her ecstatic cries as his fingers pushed deeper. &quot;I'm going to count you down now.  For each number lower than ten, you're going to drop so much deeper.  For each lower number, you're going to be so much more sensitive to my touch.&quot; The already deeply-entranced Lizzy answered with a muffled half-moan, and Vic put his lips to the edge of her ear to whisper: &quot;Ten.  Nine.  Eight...&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Mmf... mnnnhh..!&quot; Lizzy's bucking and arching became momentarily more pronounced, but quickly lessened in intensity again as the deepening trance robbed her of her strength.  Even her moaning quieted, but the subtle tension in her limbs spoke of a clear approach to her edge.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Five... four...&quot;<br />
<br />
	Her toes curled.  Fingernails dug into the couch, poking tiny holes in the fabric.  Vic's merciless fingering had her groaning against the hand cupped over her mouth.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Three... two...&quot; The silver tabby held her just over the precipice, his normally brash, confident, and occasionally violent friend clinging to the final number that would deliver her into the depths of trance and the throes of release. &quot;Hmm, should I?&quot; he pondered aloud, smirking when Lizzy arched herself against his fingers.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Mmfff...&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;What was that?&quot; Vic uncovered the kitty's mouth.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Please...&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Well, since you asked so nicely...&quot; His hand returned to silence her cries before they came, and he gently pressed the tip of his tail against her forehead. &quot;One.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Right on cue, Lizzy's entire body tensed, and she let out a ragged cry against Vic's silencing paw.  She squirmed and writhed in his lap, grinding her perfect butt into the tent in his pants as she climaxed, her sweatpants soaking with her feminine essence.  Vic's fingers twisted and wriggled inside of her, prolonging her ecstasy for as long as possible before the hypnotized feline fell still, panting and huffing.<br />
<br />
	Vic held her there for a long time, relieving her of his fingers' invasive teasing and kissing her cheek. &quot;Good girl.&quot; A quick pause to relish in her quiet moaning. &quot;How do you feel?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Sssooogood...&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Nice and relaxed?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Yessirrrr...&quot; Lizzy smiled wide, eyes half-lidded as she slumped back against him.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Not gonna be mad when you wake up?&quot; Vic waited and, distressingly, did not get an immediate answer. &quot;Lizzyyyy?&quot;<br />
<br />
	The feline girl breathed out a soft, &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;That isn't very convincing.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Mnnn, too bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Even in trance, there was a limit to this girl's compromise.  Vic couldn't help but smile, and he spent the next several minutes walking her back up; reinforcing her love for tails (his in particular!), weaving conscious and subconscious memories together so she wouldn't simply forget the fun they had... and very heavily requesting that she refrain from hitting him upon waking. &quot;Welcome back.&quot; he purred to her as the luster of awareness returned to her gaze. &quot;Now didn't I tell you it'd be fine?&quot;<br />
<br />
	Lizzy took a moment, her cheeks flushed, one hand finding Vic's and lacing her fingers with his.  She didn't immediately budge from his lap--perhaps a good sign!  The dark feline huffed, stretched herself out, and murmured, &quot;That was... awesome.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Figured you'd say that.&quot; Vic smirked--though he still wasn't sure if he was in any danger of a smack.  Lizzy always responded well to his trances, even when they turned naughty!  But his perving always landed him on thin ice.<br />
<br />
	&quot;You uh... want me to do you?  I can feel that you haven't... finished.&quot; Lizzy's voice stayed at a low mumble as she emphatically grinded herself back against the male's crotch, eliciting a little moan from his lips.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Ah, next time.&quot; Vic waved off her concern.  A tempting offer, but it was getting late, and he had classes tomorrow.  Even shameless perverts had to shut off the fun and be responsible sometimes. &quot;Besides, when do you ever get to be on the receiving end?  Enjoy that mood while you've got it.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Lizzy only nodded.  Vic had rarely seen her go under for the other sudents; apparently there were some trust issues there.  How he'd ever managed to wiggle his way around that obstacle with his constant groping and perving, he figured he'd never understand.  Lizzy finally stood and straightened out her pants, then turned and leaned forward to kiss Vic's cheek. &quot;You're still a pig.  But you're a pig who knows just which buttons to push.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Taiiiiil--&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Not listening!&quot; the cat girl's cheeks practically glowed, and she covered her ears.  Vic's snickering only brought a scowl to her lips, but one that threatened to be overtaken by a smile. &quot;I'm going to bed.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Yeah, me too.&quot; Vic rose from the couch and they said their goodnights.  Lizzy hurried along to her room--probably to change out of her now wet pants--while Vic lazily wandered over to his.  Man, if only Colette was so interested in hypnosis.  The things he could do with those tits...<br />
<br />
	That line of thought went astray when he entered his room and found a familiar purple fox lounging inside... on Vic's bed.  <br />
<br />
	&quot;Hey, buddy.  You uh... forget which room was yours again?&quot; the cat boy asked as he went to sit down at his desk.  Feri's presence wasn't entirely unwelcome; in spite of their somewhat contentious start, he and Vic got along decently well.  Plus, this wasn't the first time Feri had wandered into the wrong room after staring into a spiral for too long.  Despite their mutual friendliness, however, nothing managed to quite remove the undeniable magnetic tug of the blue and purple fox's ass.  To say that Feri's mere existence evoked some uncomfortable questions in Vic's mind would be putting it lightly.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Nope, just flopped on the closest soft thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
	The odd tone in Feri's voice sent a shiver down Vic's spine, and he turned to look at the sprawled out fox.  He quickly wished he hadn't; those were some definite bedroom eyes Feri was shooting him.  Really, that look clashed with the fox's ridiculously disheveled hair and fur.  Ah, maybe he was imagining it. &quot;Well, you look like you've had some fun today.&quot; That was a story he definitely did not need to hear, so he quickly moved on, &quot;Didn't see you come up.  Don't tell Lizzy you passed by during our little, uh... session.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Why not, though?  It was real fun to watch.&quot; There was an undeniable purr in the fox's tone, which only managed to confuse Vic even more.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Wait, you watched us?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Yeah.  Why wouldn't I?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Feri, you're--I mean, I don't wanna tell you what you are and aren't, but...&quot; Vic hesitated and wrung his fingers together.  How to say it without sounding insensitive? &quot;You told us all you were... well, gay.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Uh--&quot; A look of confusion crossed the fox's gaze, and he began to mumble to himself. &quot;But he was totally staring at... and that kitsune lady... and the locker room... wuh...?&quot;<br />
<br />
	Vic stood, moved over to sit on the bed beside the fox, and put a hand to his forehead. &quot;You ok?  Don't feel feverish.&quot; He made a face. &quot;Someone spike your drink with something extra potent?  I told you, people way less scrupulous than me hang out at those rave clubs you like.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Oh screw it.&quot; Feri took advantage of Vic's proximity and reached up to slide his arms around the cat's shoulders. &quot;You know, I am feeling a bit off.  Maybe you can... help me.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Vic had no time to question Feri's alleged predicament; the fox blinked, and when his eyes opened again, they'd changed.  Twin pits of pure blackness surrounded bright, glowing amethyst lights that demanded his attention.  His mind struggled to make sense of the strange, floating feeling that had suddenly come over him, and the impulse to shut his eyes or turn away from the enchanting glow never quite made it from brain to nerves. &quot;W-What is... what are you..?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Shhh.  No more questions.&quot; Further compounding the strangeness of this situation, a second voice seemed to layer itself over Feri's.  Something slightly lower in tone, more husky and seductive. &quot;Just look into the pretty light...&quot; Both voices began to grow distant as Vic's body became heavy and weak, his mind swimming in an all too familiar sensation.  Just like when he'd watch Lizzy's pocket watch, or when Yuriko murmured sweet nothings into his ear.  Two final words slipped through the fog forming in his head before his conscious mind slid away from him: &quot;Deep trance...&quot;<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
	The angelic fox took a deep breath and held it.  Even knocking on the door to this house was nervewracking.  Funny how facing certain death at the hands of demonic monstrosities always seemed to pale in comparison to dealing with people.  At least battlefields had some consistency.  The sound of footsteps heightened his anxiety, and the turning of the doorknob threatened to rip his heart from his chest.  A woman peered out from the space between door and frame; dark eyes framed by circular spectacles widened, and she slowly opened it the rest of the way.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Ildac?&quot; the light brown mouse woman stood agape, disbelief in her stare.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Hey... Stella.&quot; A horribly inappropriate greeting. &quot;You um... have a few minutes?  To talk?&quot;<br />
<br />
	The woman's expression raced through all imaginable emotions, and some entirely unreadable.  Shock, relief, righteous fury, and... acceptance.  She wordlessly stepped back to let him in, and he shuffled past her.  The house was decently-sized; at least it beat the apartment she'd used to live in.  Two bed, two bath, garage for two cars.  She'd worked hard.<br />
<br />
	Sitting down on her sofa, the mouse lady glued her eyes to Ildac, an understandably expectant glint in her gaze.  Without even looking, she fetched a pack of smokes from her purse and lit up a paper death stick. &quot;I'm surprised to see you.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Surprised to be here.  Can I..?&quot; Ildac waited for her to nod before taking a seat.  For a moment he could only stare at her.  Time had treated her well, it would seem.  By his recollection, she was thirty-six--not old at all, even by mortal standards, but time always managed to get away from him when it came to his mortal friends. &quot;Didn't know you smoked.&quot; he finally worked up the courage to say something.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Only started a year ago.  You know how it is.&quot; Stella gave him a wry smile and exhaled a plume of smoke. &quot;Actually you probably don't.&quot;<br />
<br />
	The fox bit his tongue.  He sure wasn't here to argue. &quot;She's at school, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
	She nodded. &quot;For another half-hour or so.  Finally come to say hello, sixteen years late?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;I meant to... sooner.&quot; A horrible lie.  She either didn't catch it or didn't care.<br />
<br />
	&quot;But something else came up.  How very human of you.&quot; Stella shed her cigarette's ashes into a tray on the table beside her.  Her stare softened as she took a deep breath. &quot;So, what changed?&quot;<br />
<br />
	Ildac straightened slightly in his seat. &quot;I think you know.&quot;<br />
<br />
	An uncomfortable silence hung in the air.  Stella dragged on her cigarette, and Ildac, seeing no danger in hiding them, let his wings fade in from the ether between worlds.  The mouse woman extinguished her cancer stick early and breathed the words, &quot;I'd hoped I'd just imagined it.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;I need to know how far she's progressed, Stella.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;It started simple.&quot; the woman sighed, slumping back against the couch.  She removed her glasses and set them aside, then pinched the bridge of her nose. &quot;The light shone on her weird.  Then she'd get spacey sometimes.  Took her to a doctor--of course they found nothing wrong.  Then one night I swear I saw her hovering six inches off the damn floor.  And now...&quot;<br />
<br />
	Ildac leaned forward. &quot;What happened?&quot;<br />
<br />
	Stella rubbed her eyelids as she slowly answered, &quot;She says she's... healing people.&quot; The severity in her tone contrasted the apparent miraculous nature of her revelation. &quot;In the schoolyard, on the street.  I guess I just didn't want to believe it...&quot;<br />
<br />
	The angel exhaled sharply as he sat back again. &quot;Nothing else?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;No.  Not yet, at least.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;No strange presences?  No open windows you're sure you'd shut--&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;What--don't ask me that!  That's terrifying.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Well, I'm sorry for that.&quot; the angel's voice rose just a touch. &quot;I need to know whether or not something else has sensed our daughter's celestial blood awakening.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Stella scoffed, indignant. &quot;Oh, suddenly she's 'our' daughter.  That's hilarious.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Again, silence descended upon the pair.  Stella scowled, and Ildac bit back the pain.  Little had he known, sixteen years ago, that his little tryst with a particularly fetching example of a mouse would culminate in such a manner.  Angelic and mortal genes tended not to mix; only a tiny fraction of encounters ever resulted in half-breeds.  How typical that he'd be careless enough to win that lottery.<br />
<br />
	&quot;That's fair.&quot; Ildac finally said.  He hadn't exactly been present in any tangible manner.<br />
<br />
	&quot;No--it's--dammit.&quot; the mouse woman groaned as she rose from her seat to pace around the living room. &quot;I didn't forget every birthday and Christmas present, every bit of money you manage to send.  You aren't a deadbeat, and I shouldn't act like you are.&quot; She snorted, finally showing a touch of the humor he'd known her for. &quot;Should be glad you didn't just up and Zeus me, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
	Ildac dismissed that with a wave. &quot;So you've noticed nothing else strange, then?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;No.  It's purely Aura that's been acting weird.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Then we're lucky.  If that holds up, this will be way easier than I feared.&quot; Ildac watched Stella pace.  She still had that same energy he'd admired when she was a young adult. &quot;I'll have to teach her to disguise her essence.  A simple affair, now that she's actively controlling it.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;And then what?  You disappear on her again?&quot; There wasn't venom in her tone this time.  No, her words dripped with something far worse.  Ildac rose and made his way across the room--to nowhere in particular, really.  There weren't any proper answers to that.  No true ones, anyway.  Denied a response, Stella pressed. &quot;Ok, so you and I were never more than a... fling.  That doesn't matter.  Family doesn't have to mean marriage or even being in love.  But Aura needs a father.  I can only make up the story of where her totally-not-an-angel daddy went for so long before she grows into the legal right to ask a geneticist.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;I can't be that for her.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;And why not?  Because you're busy?  Because some day you might die doing whatever the hell it is you do?  I'd risk the same thing if I married a soldier.&quot; Stella huffed, averting her eyes from him.  She busied herself with a tea kettle, setting water to boil while Ildac watched, paralyzed by his fears.  The mouse woman stared down at the bright blue flame on the stove. &quot;Are you ashamed of what we did?  Is that it?&quot;<br />

            ====Continued====<br />
<br />
The twist of the dagger.  Ildac felt something catch in his throat and rub it raw.  Somehow he still managed to find the strength to speak. &quot;I'm not ashamed of what came of it.  How could I be?  From the moment I first held her, I knew she'd...&quot; A fleeting smile sneaked its way to his lips. &quot;She would be all the best things in you, and more.  What a beautiful soul that shone in her.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;She's the best of you, too.  Even if she doesn't know it.&quot; Stella sighed heavily.  She leaned against the counter, still avoiding looking at the angel. &quot;Aura's a bit of a handful.  Not having a father has made her more... rough, I guess.  She's very willful.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Like you.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Fair point.&quot; Stella managed to smile now. &quot;I don't hate you for not being here.  You're literally from another world.  The things you're beholden to... I can't even imagine them.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;But that isn't--&quot; Ildac stopped himself short, his courage falling flat when those deep brown eyes found his.  Somehow, he managed to dredge it back up. &quot;I was too afraid to be anything more than a provider.&quot; Faced with no response, he let the floodgates slowly open. &quot;The word 'family' and I don't have a good history.  Getting involved with it again would only mean opening myself up to that pain.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Stella only watched him for a while.  He'd never told her of his past.  The terrible losses he'd endured. &quot;It doesn't have to mean that.&quot;<br />
<br />
	The fox managed a humorless laugh.  Of course it did.  Some day, Stella would die.  Eventually even the half-breed Aura would expire.  Once again, he'd be alone, with only his memories to keep him going. &quot;I avoided coming here because of the inevitable pain I'd feel in the end... giving up the memories I could have made.  Depriving Aura of a father, and you of a... I don't even know.&quot; He hung his head, even as Stella pushed herself off the counter to hug one arm around his waist. &quot;I convinced myself that maybe, if I stayed away, she'd never learn what she was.  Never understand the immensity of what could awaken within her and turn her life upside down.  All so I could spare myself the pain of saying goodbye again.&quot; The fox's voice shook. &quot;I'm a coward.  I don't deserve to be her father.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;You,&quot; the mouse woman rose her voice to a scolding tone.  She flicked him on the nose and forced him to look at her. &quot;Are a self-deprecating little shit of an angel.  You're awkward, fumbling, and scared, and you fuck up like the best of us.  But...&quot; her tone softened, and she smiled at him. &quot;You came back.  Sure, you're late as hell, but you didn't let go of her.  And now here you are, beating yourself up like you always do.  That's supposed to be my job in this scenario.&quot;<br />
<br />
	He hardly deserved to be comforted, and deserved her smile even less.  But maybe she was right. &quot;How very human of me.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Stella laughed.  It wasn't loud or particularly heartful, but it was the most wonderful thing to hear right now. &quot;You helped me bring Aura into this world--gave me this beautiful miracle of a daughter.  And no matter what you've done in the past, you're here now.  Believe what you want about how much or how little you deserve to be her father.  But Aura deserves you.  When she walks through that door, she needs to know who and what you are.  You aren't just the guy who's gonna teach her how to not attract literal hellspawn to the door.&quot; Her tone turned more stern. &quot;But if you do decide to tell her the truth--the whole truth--I need you to promise me something.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Not until I hear it.&quot;<br />
<br />
	The mouse steeled herself; every muscle seemed to tense as she breathed in stiffly. &quot;If you intend to walk away and never come back... then forget everything I just said.  Don't tell her you're her father.  Better for her to never know, than to know and wonder why you've left her again.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Fuck.  Ildac swallowed the lump in his throat and gave her a weak nod.  Do or die.  A fair stance, considering his track record. &quot;I can't promise it'd be often.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;That's fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Or consistent.  Or even how long I could--&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Ildac.  It's fine.&quot; Stella took him by his shoulders--a humorous sight for the significantly shorter mouse woman. &quot;Just... promise me you'll try.  Please.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Those sad, soulful eyes of hers were impossible to deny.  His own woes aside, he truly needed to do this.  What kind of man would he be if he didn't?  Hell, what kind of man had he been for the past decade and a half? &quot;I promise.  I mean it, though; angel schedules are infinitely subject to change.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Then we'll just have to make it--&quot; The sound of a doorknob turning cut her off, and their attention focused on the door.  Ildac's heart practically leaped from his chest as it slowly swung open--!<br />
<br />
	Something like an electric shock to the soul ripped him away from his reminiscing.  Ildac opened his eyes and picked his head up off his desk, immediately turning toward the source of an undeniable demonic presence.  He stood so quickly that his chair rolled back and collided with the wall, startling his sleepy lupine roommate awake.<br />
<br />
	&quot;What's got you all spooked?&quot; Nuri yawned, rolling over to face the tense angel. &quot;You've got that serious look in your eye again.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;That frigging demon I've been chasing all damn day.&quot; Ildac stared ahead, trying to line up the demonic aura's location with his mental map of the school. &quot;Every time I got close, it disappeared, only to manifest hours later on the other side of the campus.  But now...&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;It it close?&quot; Nuri's tone remained level, and she seemed quite unconcerned with the thought. &quot;You gonna go get it?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Naturally.&quot;<br />
<br />
	The wolf girl yawned again and rolled back over, pulling the covers over her head. &quot;M'kay.  Come snuggle me when you're done.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Typical Nuri.  What others might have mistaken for indifference, Ildac recognized as confidence.  Confidence that he'd be back in time to cuddle up for the night, no worse for wear.  The fox smiled, hunched over the bed to smooch her through the blanket, and quietly slipped out of the room.<br />
<br />
	&lt;Aura.&gt; he reached out through the ether until he felt his daughter's soul at the end of it. &lt;Do you sense it?&gt;<br />
<br />
	&lt;Uh... you can hear me, right?&gt; Aura's telepathic voice echoed a little, but she'd apparently managed to grasp the concept of soul speaking.  Ildac would have time to be proud of her later.  For now, there was a hunt to be had.<br />
<br />
	&lt;Loud and clear.  The demon's in the Block G dorm.&gt;<br />
<br />
	&lt;You're lucky I didn't find someone to do.&gt;<br />
<br />
	&lt;You mean 'something', right?&gt;<br />
<br />
	&lt;I know what I said.&gt;<br />
<br />
	Ildac groaned, and the cheeky mouse must have picked up on it; he sensed a tremor of laughter from her end. &lt;Just meet me at the damn dorms.  And muffle your presence like we've practiced.&gt;<br />
<br />
	The quick jaunt over to the Block G dorm building only confirmed Ildac's suspicion; since he and Aura had masked their celestial energies, the demon's own presence remained as plain as day to those with the right senses.  It hadn't tried to flee or hide yet, owing to their more stealthy approach.  If only he'd tried this earlier.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Hey, over here.&quot; Aura quietly called out as she bounded over to her father, joining him at the dorm entrance. &quot;Any idea what we're dealing with yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Not until I get closer.  Feels like it's still possessing a mortal body, though.&quot; Ildac's eyes narrowed, and he produced his student ID card to unlock the front door. &quot;I don't think it's too far up.  We shouldn't have to search for long.&quot;<br />
<br />
	The pair moved inside.  No one lingered in the lounge at this point, and the halls were as quiet as usual for this time of night.  They took the stairs leading up, following their senses until they reached the third floor.  Ildac paused and gave Aura an expectant look.  At first she offered a confused stare in return, but she gradually pieced together what he wanted her to do.  She shut her eyes and reached out a hand; light seemed to bend around her, forming a faint golden halo around her body as she sought out the source of the demonic presence.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Good.  Connect the strands you can feel, but stop before you reach the target.  You let your strands connect, and it'll know we're here.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Getting closer...&quot; Aura furrowed her brow.  Her eyes rolled around beneath their lids as she searched, body weaving to and fro.  She still had some refining to do, but she'd definitely improved since Ildac had left her to her own devices. &quot;There.&quot; Her eyes shot open, and she led Ildac up one more flight of stairs, rounded a corner, and stopped before a door.<br />
<br />
	Ildac frowned.  The noises he heard from behind that door were... questionable, at best. &quot;You sure?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;You're the full-blood.  You give it a feel.&quot;<br />
<br />
	The fox reached out in much the same manner as his daughter had, albeit with a far more practiced touch.  Strands of divine energy laced together to form one solid line, edging closer and closer to the source of infernal taint until he could practically feel it in his hands.  Sure enough, Aura's senses had been accurate; the demonic intruder was behind this door.  Judging from the smirk forming on her lips, she had also begun to piece together what awaited them. &quot;I hate my job sometimes.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Aura put her hand on the doorknob and tested it.  Luckily, it turned just fine, and the pair hesitated before slowly pushing it open.  The sight that lay ahead confirmed Ildac's suspicion: There lay Feri, bent over a bed with his ass in the air, and a very, very entranced Vic in the process of pounding it.  Aura practically glowed with glee, while Ildac facepalmed harder than he had in weeks. &quot;I really hate it.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Speak for yourself.&quot; Aura grinned, taking the lead for all of a split second before turning back to Ildac. &quot;So what do we do?&quot;<br />
<br />
	The fox sighed.  It seemed even their intrusion had gone unnoticed.  That, or the demon simply didn't care who watched.  A quick reach with his senses showed him that Feri was the one possessed, which was really no surprise.  That boy was basically born to be incubus bait. &quot;Let's get this over with, you infernal pain in the ass.&quot; Ildac immediately regretted his choice of words, given the scene playing out before his eyes, but rolled with it anyway. &quot;Let the kitty go before you traumatize him more than you already have.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Eh?  But he's having so much fun!&quot; Feri's voice rang in a strange tone, another voice speaking in perfect unison with his own.  He smirked at the two newcomers, eyes flashing a deeply mesmerizing shade of purple. &quot;C'mon.  Join us...&quot;<br />
<br />
	Ildac's mind reeled only slightly to the hypnotic assault; perhaps he'd have to thank Nuri later for training him so well.  Prior to meeting her, he folded like a house of cards to this kind of seduction.  Aura, on the other hand, swooned and put a hand to her head. &quot;Unnh... Holy fuck...&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Fight it.&quot; Ildac kept his tone stern and stepped in front of his daughter.<br />
<br />
	&quot;That feels... so good...&quot; Aura's eyes glazed over slightly, but a quick shake of her head brought her back to awareness. &quot;Gah!  Ok, I'm good!  I'm good.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Well, at least she had a base resistance to mind control.  Unlike her dad.  Ildac addressed the possessed Feri again, certainly not in the mood to see his daughter join in on this infernal fuckfest. &quot;I'm not gonna warn you again, hellspawn.  We can do this the easy way or the hard way.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Mmm, hard.  You're gonna be hard when I get th--&quot; Feri paused, as if in realization.  He held up a hand, and the mind-fucked Vic ceased his mindless humping. &quot;What did you call me?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;I think you heard me.&quot; Ildac crossed his arms.<br />
<br />
	The gears turned in the possessed fox's head, and his look of confusion quickly morphed to one of dread. &quot;Oh fuck.  You're the... the angel I sensed?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Both of us are.&quot; Aura peeked out from behind Ildac, apparently having regained her confidence. &quot;Now come here so I can wreck your shit!&quot; How perfectly angelic of her.  Ildac almost facepalmed again.<br />
<br />
	Feri gazed frantically around the room; his eyes flicked multiple times toward the window, but he seemed to weigh that option quite heavily. &quot;Uh--um--catslave!  Tackle him!&quot;<br />
<br />
	Vic, in his entranced state, didn't so much tackle Ildac as he did clumsily stumble into him.  He ineffectually tried to grab the fox and pull him to the ground, but Ildac's ridiculous strength held firm. &quot;Mmmmaster, he's too tough.&quot; Vic whined, eyes glassy and unfocused.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Useless!&quot; Feri flicked his wrist, and the window behind him flung open.  The fox jumped back with surprising grace and leapt from the window, only to float effortlessly in the air. &quot;I'm not gonna tangle with two angels!&quot;<br />
<br />
	Ildac sighed heavily as the possessed femboi flew off into the night.  So, this was how it was going to be, then. &quot;Watch over Vic.&quot; he mumbled to Aura as his wings burst free from beyond the veil of reality.<br />
<br />
	&quot;What?  I thought we were gonna slay the demon together!&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Can you fly yet?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;N-No.&quot; Aura huffed and crossed her arms. &quot;You didn't teach me!&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Too bad, so sad.&quot; He ignored her protesting after that and jumped out the window in pursuit.  This had gone from a casual hunt to a hostage situation the moment it all went airborne.  He took flight in Feri's direction, the demon-influenced fox squeaking in fear and speeding up!<br />
<br />
	&lt;Leave me alone!&gt; the voice of the demon rang clearly in Ildac's head.<br />
<br />
	&lt;Stop flying around and causing a scene!&gt;<br />
<br />
	&lt;Then stop CHASING ME!&gt; Ildac groaned as the flighty fox only accelerated further, forcing him to do the same.  Oh, anyone looking up at the night sky was in for a real treat if these two happened to catch the moonlight just right.<br />
<br />
	&lt;This isn't gonna end well for you!&gt;<br />
<br />
	&lt;That's not what you say to someone who you want to STOP running!&gt; The demon's voice was positively frantic.  It drove Feri through the air in ridiculously dangerous maneuvers, buzzing the various dorm and school buildings, flying way too low, and dodging between trees in an effort to shake off the pursuing angel.<br />
<br />
	Ildac quickly grew tired of this game of chase.  Not only was his classmate's life in jeopardy, but this pathetic excuse for a demon was actually making him work for his win.  He wasn't sure which actually pissed him off more.  The angel conjured up a spear of divine energy and hurled it forward--it crackled through the air and arced dangerously close to Feri, who squealed in terror and went spinning off to the left.  Unfortunately, he banked far too hard and lost control, careening toward the ground and smashing right into... boobs.<br />
<br />
	Aura's feet dug into the ground as she caught the crashing fox, the momentum sending her grinding backwards at least ten feet.  She clenched her teeth as her celestial strength won out, bringing herself and the now captive fox to a halt.<br />
<br />
	&lt;Nice save.&gt; Ildac breathed a sigh of relief as he glided to a landing.<br />
<br />
	&quot;That was awful reckless of you.&quot; the mouse scowled at Ildac, holding onto the half-struggling, half-boob-nuzzling fox. &quot;What if I hadn't been here?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Demonic possessions bestow a portion of the entity's strength to the possessed mortal.&quot; Ildac held a hand out to his side and summoned his blade into the material realm. &quot;He'd have lived.&quot;<br />
<br />
	The demon inside Feri, seeing the blade and suddenly remembering his plight, abandoned the soft comfort of Aura's bosom and squeaked fearfully. &quot;Please don't kill me!  I've done nothing wrong!&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;You're an incubus.  How many souls have you swallowed since you got here?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;None!  I swear!&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;The Justicar's blade will decide that.&quot; Ildac pointed the tip of the sword at Feri's chest.  A two-faceted gem--one half red, one half blue--spun within the hilt.  Faster and faster, the gem twirled on its axis, then came to an abrupt stop... on the blue side. &quot;Wait what--&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;I told you I'm innocent!&quot; Tears gathered at the edges of Feri's eyes, and he clasped his hands together pleadingly. &quot;I just wanted a little fun!  A-And maybe to drink up all the delicious sensual energy that my antics made... But I didn't hurt anyone!&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;I... you...&quot; An uncomfortable feeling rose up in Ildac's chest; the sudden realization that he'd risked exposure over a harmless prankster.  The tips of his ears burned, and he knew his face was turning red.<br />
<br />
	Aura immediately picked up on this and loosened her grip on the sniffling fox. &quot;Kora's blade doesn't lie, does it?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Never.&quot; the fox mumbled the word.  He almost wished the blade could be faulty.  Better that than admit to overreacting like he had.  He dispelled the divine weapon, then turned to address Feri--or rather, the thing controlling Feri. &quot;Can we talk face to face?  Without you puppeteering the fox?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;You're not gonna kill me, are you?&quot; The demon's voice spoke in tandem with Feri's, and he swiped a couple stray tears from the boi's cheeks.<br />
<br />
	Ildac sighed heavily. &quot;I literally can't now.  You've nothing to fear.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Feri's uninvited body guest mulled this over for a moment, then finally conceded and relinquished control.  A bronze-skinned, silver-haired boy emerged from the fox, transparent at first but slowly solidifying.  The separation was apparently too much for Feri, who immediately passed out and fell against Ildac's chest.  The angel looked upon the face of Feri's latest 'friend' and took a long breath. &quot;What's your name, troublemaker?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Kixxera.&quot; the silver-haired boy spoke lowly, his long, spade-tipped tail curling self-consciously around his ankle.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Oh my goddess, he's cute.&quot; Aura gushed, much to Ildac's chagrin.  She bounced forward and hugged the newly-emerged incubus against her chest. &quot;Now I'm really glad we didn't kill him!&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;I'm sure glad your priorities are straight.&quot; Ildac groaned.  He waited for Kixxera to free himself (which took way longer than he'd have preferred) before addressing him again. &quot;I'm not thrilled with what you've done here.  Poor Vic is going to have some very concerning lapses in memory that I'm sure he'll quickly fill in, given how you left him.  To say nothing of the commotion you caused tonight, which could have easily exposed all of us as supernatural entities.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Hey, you chased me.&quot; Kixxera quipped, but immediately regretted it and shrank under Ildac's irate scowl. &quot;Ok, ok, I'm sorry!  I'm sorry!&quot;<br />
<br />
	The fox stared at the boy for a long while.  Sure, he'd caused some trouble, and he probably wouldn't give half a shit about it had he not been caught.  But he hadn't caused any harm, and there was potential for some good to come of this. &quot;If you're willing to behave, I think we can work something out.  But let's do that indoors, away from prying eyes, yes?&quot;<br />
<br />
	At the very least, the whole lot of them agreed to that.  They headed inside for a long, potentially uncomfortable conversation.  Still, Ildac could breathe easy; Feri was safe, he couldn't sense anyone awake in the dorms, and their masquerade was apparently intact.  All in all, it could have gone worse.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
	The sun's rays kissed the land once again, and Saint Gerald University slowly buzzed to life.  No mention of any strange flying boys was made, and it would appear that no one realized anything out of the ordinary had happened at all.  No one, of course, except for Vic, who appeared in the cafeteria at breakfast time looking like he'd seen a ghost.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Jesus, man, what happened!&quot; Lizzy was immediately at her friend's side, eyes wide with concern.<br />
<br />
	&quot;L-Last night.  The memories are real fuzzy, but... but...&quot; The silver tabby's eyes flicked around the table, where students from the G and D Blocks gathered with stacks of pancakes and piles of egg. &quot;I know for a fact that my key had been in a hole that it shouldn't have fit!&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;What he means to say,&quot; Ildac cut in and offered cautiously, &quot;is that he was a little too drunk and horny last night and, uh... partook of Feri's forbidden fruit.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Whoa.&quot; Lizzy stared at the whimpering Vic and sighed.  She hugged his head to her chest and gently caressed his ears. &quot;It's ok, honey.  I'll make all the bad memories go away for you.&quot; The traumatized cat only nodded to her, and she kissed his forehead gently.  Her gaze turned toward an approaching Feri, and she winced when Vic looked up as well.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Saboteur!&quot; he yelled, pointing an accusing finger. &quot;Foul pseudo-temptress of the night!&quot;<br />
<br />
	Feri, looking positively ragged, only gave Vic a confused look. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;<br />
<br />
	Lizzy gave Feri an odd look. &quot;You don't remember?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Last night's a real blur...&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Deceiver!  Forbidden ass-cheeks of depravity!&quot; Vic continued to mercilessly and yet oddly poetically scold the fox.<br />
<br />
	&quot;It's too early for sillies, silly.&quot; Feri yawned and rubbed his sleepy eyes.<br />
<br />
	&quot;My temple has been violated!&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Hush, hush.&quot; Lizzy gently covered Vic's mouth as he continued to rant, and gave Feri an apologetic smile. &quot;We'll explain later.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Ildac cast a glance Aura's way as she grinned from ear to ear. &lt;Don't say a word.&gt;<br />
<br />
	&lt;I know, I know.&gt; the celestial mouse went back to her breakfast, tail swaying in place behind her.<br />
<br />
	Sitting beside Ildac, Nuri leaned over to whisper to the angel. &quot;So, you took care of things last night?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;You could say that.&quot; He'd gotten back well after his lupine mistress had dozed off. &quot;We shouldn't have any more trouble from that particular nuisance.&quot;<br />
<br />
	A faint commotion drew the fox's attention, and he felt another facepalm come on when he saw what was causing it.  Quickly approaching, wearing what could have only been the most accurate Japanese schoolgirl cosplay ever, was a familiar bronze-skinned and silver-haired boy with bright violet eyes... minus horns and tail.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Hello!&quot; the boy chirped as he stopped before their table. &quot;I'm a new student here!  Name's Kixxera, but you all can just call me Kixxy.  I hope we can be friends!&quot;<br />
<br />
	&lt;Still think we shouldn't have killed him?&gt; Ildac glared in Aura's direction, and she laughed openly.  Everyone at the table stared in confusion, and the still whimpering Vic and very tired Feri almost looked like they recognized something in that chipper &quot;newcomer&quot;.  Ildac rose from his seat, cleared his throat, and made his way around the table. &quot;Well, newbie, I don't see why not!  Let my 'friend' and I teach you the ropes, huh?&quot;<br />
<br />
	Taking the hint, Aura stood and followed them to a quiet part of the cafeteria, leaving the table far more confused than before.  Kixxy beamed at the two celestials and did a little twirl. &quot;Well?  Perfect, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Perfect wrong!&quot; Ildac growled, glancing around the cafeteria.  Surely enough, Kixxy's outfit was still getting him second (and third, fourth, and fifth) glances. &quot;I said you could stay if you didn't draw attention to yourself!&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;And I'm not.  I dressed like a student.&quot;<br />
<br />
	The demon boy's genuine confusion only irritated Ildac more. &quot;Y-You're dressed like you just walked out of an anime convention!&quot;<br />
<br />
	Kixxy's amethyst gaze flicked down to his clothing, then slowly rose back up to meet Ildac's eyes. &quot;You mean not all students wear stuff like this?&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Do you see anyone else?!&quot;<br />
<br />
	Another awkward pause.  The incubus searched the cafeteria, a look of startled realization creeping into his expression. &quot;Oh.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Yeah, 'oh'.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Well I think it's perfect.&quot; Aura smirked, sliding an arm around Kixxy's shoulder.  Her tail found its way around the boy's waist, her voice dropping to a low purr. &quot;Welcome to the school, new guy.  I'd be glad to show you around...&quot;<br />
<br />
	Ildac's breakfast threaten to rise from his stomach, and he quickly decided to put a cap on that. &quot;Well, since you're so elated by his presence, daughter, he can be your responsibility.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Wait what--&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Yep.  I think that's the perfect idea.&quot; the angelic fox turned back toward their table. &quot;Keep him in line.  If you don't, you're going to hear about it at length.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Wait... No!  This wasn't part of the deal!&quot; Aura grabbed at Ildac's shoulder, but he shrugged her off. &quot;I just wanted to have some fun with him, not babysit him!  That's no fair!&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Life isn't fair.&quot;<br />
<br />
	&quot;Damn you!&quot;<br />
<br />
	Ildac made his way back over to flop down next to Nuri, ignoring Aura's threats of vengeance.  He couldn't help but grin a little.  Maybe this would teach that daughter of his some respect for her position in the world.  Or maybe she'd completely ignore it and let Kixxy run amok.  Either way, it was currently no longer his problem!  Such a weight off his shoulders was enough for him to ignore the confused stares he was getting as he finished off his pancakes.<br />
<br />
	&quot;So, was that..?&quot; Nuri inquired in a hushed whisper.<br />
<br />
	&quot;Oh yeah.  Demons are territorial creatures.&quot; the angelic fox whispered back with a smile. &quot;If he stays here, others will be less inclined to intrude.  And Kixxy's so ridiculously harmless that it just made sense.&quot; Casting another glance toward the demon boi, his smile faded into a scowl. &quot;Assuming he learns how to goddamn dress like a normal person.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Nuri giggled and jumped in to steal a bite of pancake right off his fork. &quot;It'll be fine.  Relax.&quot;<br />
<br />
	Ildac rolled his eyes, but conceded with a nod.  As far as demonic incursions went, this one had been surprisingly tame.  Sure, Vic was going to need several hypnosis sessions to get Feri's ass off his mind, and the &quot;new student&quot; knew as much about school life as he did about personal boundaries, but things were peaceful now.  And that was all he could ask of this strange, crazy world sometimes.        </div>
